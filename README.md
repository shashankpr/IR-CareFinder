## Project 1: CareFinder
**Owner: https://mytomorrows.com & Web Information Systems (Alessandro Bozzon)**

To date, no Web search engine allows to search for hospitals and clinics by the type of  specialist care they offer. This is information typically available on an hospitalâ€™s Website, but not structured in such a way to allow exploration. Also, there is little information about the quality of the doctors, for which some information could be available on-line. For instance, by looking in online repositories for articles published by doctors of the hospital (e.g. on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) , or for ongoing clinical trials (e.g. https://clinicaltrials.gov)

**Assignment:** design and implement a sensemaking system that, given a country or region of references, scouts from social data (e.g. FourSquare) hospitals, identify their public information (e.g Website), extract the list of disciplines and related doctors, and provide a measure of quality of care based on the scientific productivity such doctors, and on the presence of active clinical trials.
