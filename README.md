Repository for Information Retrieval, Group 13.

## Project 1: CareFinder
**Owner: https://mytomorrows.com & Web Information Systems (Alessandro Bozzon)**

To date, no Web search engine allows to search for hospitals and clinics by the type of  specialist care they offer. This is information typically available on an hospitalâ€™s Website, but not structured in such a way to allow exploration. Also, there is little information about the quality of the doctors, for which some information could be available on-line. For instance, by looking in online repositories for articles published by doctors of the hospital (e.g. on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) , or for ongoing clinical trials (e.g. https://clinicaltrials.gov)

**Assignment:** design and implement a sensemaking system that, given a country or region of references, scouts from social data (e.g. FourSquare) hospitals, identify their public information (e.g Website), extract the list of disciplines and related doctors, and provide a measure of quality of care based on the scientific productivity such doctors, and on the presence of active clinical trials. 


## Tools used

- python-dotenv [https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv]
- rq [http://python-rq.org/]
- rq-dashboard [https://github.com/eoranged/rq-dashboard]

The rq package give an simple and easy task queue in python. 
Internally it uses a redis server and doesn't require a special task queue server.
The queue's can be monitored with the rq-dashboard tool.

To prevent leaking secrets with our source repository we will use so called environment variables.
By using the dotenv package we can define these variables in a .env file and exclude this from our repo.
